# First Person

This is a Runelite plugin which enables a (janky) first-person perspective. When moving the camera, it will render a frame of where the camera attempts to move, prior to the plugin correcting its position. 

As this plugin makes use of the Occulus mode of camera, you will be unable to interact with any NPCs or Objects whilst the plugin is on.
