# First Person

This is a Runelite plugin which enables a (janky) first-person perspective. The perspective will actually be slightly behind where the player's face is due to limitations on the zoom functionality in the game.

This plugin can potentially have conflicts with the 'Camera' plugin, so the two cannot be enabled at the same time.
